# Mental Stress Detection
## Heart Rate Variability (HRV) dataset for research and detection of stress and user modeling

The original dataset contains raw ECG signal and a feature dataset which is annotated with the conditions under which the data was collected. It also contained heart rate variability (HRV) feature (only RMSSD) that was computed every one minute. This limiting and lead to the conclusion that HRV was not a good predictor of office stressor. This dataset is more comprehensive and allows to predict the stressor with a 99.25% accuracy. For more details, refer to our published paper included in this dataset.

## STEPS

1) Download train.csv and test.csv file from kaggle. Link: https://www.kaggle.com/qiriro/swell-heart-rate-variability-hrv
2) Run Run.py , which gives information about HRV computation and a rough implementation of the concept and can be modified to achieve even greater results.
